# "Who knows what the stars have in store for us?" 

## Iodine - Roleplayer - Animator - Artist - Writer - 17 - Male

### I am a very busy person but I still like to have fun! I'm mostly writing stories, roleplaying in ponytown, or drawing.

### Boundaries are important so here! This is for roleplays and just chatting in general.

### 🐏 Iodine's Boundaries🐏

#### ☆: Don’t ship my character without my permission, even if you think they’re a “perfect match.” Ask first.

#### ☆: Don't tramua dump to me without asking first. 

#### ☆ : Don’t make jokes about schizophrenia, hallucinations, paranoia, or anything similar. Those aren’t punchlines, I deal with a similar illness.

#### ☆ : Don’t kill off my character without my consent, it fustrates me.

#### ☆ : I shouldn't have to say this but don't ALTER my characters lore.

#### ☆ :  No NSFW content, period.

#### ☆ :  No degrading language or dynamics without a clear spoiler text & warning. 

#### ☆ : I’m a very literal person, so I might not understand jokes or sarcasm right away. Please be clear if you’re joking.

#### ☆ : Don’t make fun of my spelling or grammar. I struggle with English

#### ☆ : Respect my boundaries the same way you’d want yours respected.

#### ˗ˏˋ  🪽   ˎˊ˗

#### ☆ : Everything else I'm completly fine with but if I do find something uncomfortable I'll let you know ^^!

#### "“These boundaries are here to keep things fun and comfortable for everyone. If you can’t respect them, we won’t interact or I'll simply block you.”
